# Kingdom Cocktails

This is a website intended to provide interested parties with information on the annual Kingdom Cocktails festival that takes place in Dunfermline.

Users of the website will be able to find out what events are coming up as part of the festival in 2023, they will be able to look through a gallery of images from previous events, and they will be able to register their interest to find out more about up and coming events.
